						<p>Initially, we were introduced to 'Oculus Go', which is the model that our client had specified 
							for us to use. However, the model does not support a motion sensor. By contrast, our VR application
							targets to register motion input to ensure maximal interaction between players. After having a 
							brief conversation regarding the VR kit requirement with our client, we managed to upgrade our 
							specified kit from 'Oculus Go' to 'Oculus Quest'. It not only includes motion sensor but also provides 
							head and hand detection.</p>
						<p>In terms of the online software, we chose unity because unity as game development kit and engine
							designed supports 'Oculus Quest' and 3D Android development. Compared to other kits, unity is indeed 
							developer-friendly with regard to the complexity and effectiveness especially during in a short time period.</p>
						<p>From the related research articles we found, creating multiplayer VR games would still be 
							problematic due to the lack of money and severe competition from traditional business game chain 
							productions. </p>
						<p>As unity only supports C sharp, we didnâ€™t consider using other programming languages. When 
							setting up the user interface, only creating C# scripts on visual studio would be fine. For the 
							frameworks, Balsamiq is adopted to design the whole process. APIs of Oculus Quest, Watson Assistant 
							and Pun2 are used as well to connect the hardware, to add NPCs and to implement the voice interface 
							respectively. </p>
						<p>We also applied Photon Voice 2 and Photon Unity Networking 2 as well. IBM Waston is adopted in speech to text, text to speech process.
							Waston Assistant is presented in the area of Chatbot which means providing extra NPCs.</p>
						<p>To sum up the final decision, we agreed to adopt Oculus Quest due to supporting motion sensor to 
							be our hardware. Unity including C# would be software. Other additional but necessary functionalities 
							would be implemented by using Watson Assistant and Pun2. </p>
