						<h2>Critical evaluation of the project</h2>
						<p>This initial prototype has indeed beyond our expectations. Our team divided this task into three
							sections, and each of us is in charge of it. When we tried to merge everything together, the process
							was quite smooth and different from what we thought. The design and development process was delightful
							and satisfied. We will try to make our project more successful in the near future. </p>

						<h2>Future work</h2>
						<p>In this following term, we prefer to finish integrate voice to the chat rooms firstly.
							This is completed using an add-on for Photon Unity Networking 2 called Photon Voice 2. It 
							will allow synchronous audio recording and output, and as it is supported by the Photon Cloud, 
							it will have minimal latency. 
							Besides that, we would like to fully implement Watson Assistant.
							This should allow users to have small dialogues with the assistant. 
							More research is going done on cognitive computing, for it to be able to handle a wider range of conversations. 
						</p>	
						<p>Furthermore, completing the user interface would comes to the first.
							That includes designing and implementing all the features of the settings
							and combine all the avatars and landscapes to appear in one scene.
							Integrating the application is currently running on Desktop to Oculus Quest.
							This is done by adding the Oculus integration asset.
							More testings will be done by us on this aspect to ensure that it is running properly.
						</p>
						<p>After that, designing an avatar is necessary which is able to naturally move by including Unity assets 
							such as Salsa LipSyncing Suite. 

							To add more functionalities and make the application uses be more diverse, we will 
							implement other features outside of the chat, such as a single player games. 
							This can be simple games, such as tic tac toe. 

							The last but not least is to allow Watson to read blogs and news. 
							As the Watson assistant is able to convert Text-to-Speech, a feasible option is to 
							create an algorithm which is able to search the internet and filter through websites. 
							After finding the appropriate article, it will read the first few lines, and prompt the 
							user whether they want to continue with the text or move on to other activities.
