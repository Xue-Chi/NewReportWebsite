						<h2>Representing users</h2>
						<p>In order to familiarize what the users need, besides the persona we finished, we also tried to create a scenario:</p>
	    				<p>James is a retired man living in the countryside. He has been alone ever since his wife passed away. All his relatives 
							and friends are living in the city, which is 2-hour drive away from his house. He always feels lonely not only because 
							he has minimal interactions with neighbors, but also since he wants to prevent any disturbances to his childrenâ€™s work life. 
							With his age, James is not willing to drive for hours at a time. Besides, he thinks he is too weak to travel to any other 
							places by himself. His only wish is for his children and friends to pay him a visit occasionally. </p>

						<h2>Design Principals</h2>
						<p>Concerning the target population, the most essential usability is simplicity. Elderly people may quit the assistant 
							if the procedure is complicated. From this thought, we tried to make the interface tidy and easy to use. Therefore, 
							we designed the wireframes followed by drawing the sketches by hand. </p>
